# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository. Maybe my life will change.

My changes:
1. I want to actually have a future- a career of some kind, not a series of jobs 
2. I should have thought about this long ago, so I'm essentially screwed- but I'll try a couple of things out 
3. I need to start doing things
